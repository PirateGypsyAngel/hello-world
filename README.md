beginners attempt to build a productive and successful small company 
 
New to this vwrt confusing world of coding. This is like the calculus of language arts! New and upcoming entrepreneur I fancy myself running and ruling a small business sharing my own goods. I'm a single mother with a background in Healthcare, Entertainment, Childcare, Music and Labor. I love animals music and warmth! I enjoy reading, drawing, writing and gardening in my spare time.
